Everything in the vbcc/ subdirectory is (c) 2002-2016 Volker Barthelmann.

The initial checkin of the vbcc/ subdirectory contains the
source code of Volker Barthelmann's VBCC compiler circa version 0.9b,
as downloaded on 2012-05-02 from http://www.ibaug.de/vbcc/vbcc.tar.gz.

Subsequent commits on the master branch of this repository contain
later releases of VBCC. I intend to commit bugfixes to the Z-Machine
backend on a different (non-master) branch.

Barthelmann's license text is included in the TEXI documentation
in this directory (vbcc/doc/vbcc.texi), and also available online
at http://www.ibaug.de/vbcc/doc/vbcc.html, but here it is again:
